## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk Areas ✅
- **Build Process**: Stable and automated
- **SEO Implementation**: Comprehensive and tested
- **Form Handling**: Secure with proper validation
- **Performance**: Optimized caching and bundle size

### Medium Risk Areas ⚠️
- **External Dependencies**: Hygraph CMS and third-party services
- **Dynamic Content**: CMS-driven pages require runtime validation
- **Analytics**: Third-party scripts (GTM, Termly) outside direct control

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Graceful Degradation**: Static fallbacks for dynamic content
- **Error Boundaries**: React error boundaries for component failures
- **Monitoring**: Performance and error tracking recommended
- **Content Validation**: Schema validation for CMS data

## Recommendations for Production

### Immediate Actions
1. **Environment Variables**: Ensure all production environment variables are configured
2. **CMS Content**: Validate all Hygraph content matches expected schemas
3. **DNS Configuration**: Verify canonical URL domain matches actual deployment domain
4. **Analytics Setup**: Confirm GTM and GA4 tracking codes are production-ready

### Ongoing Monitoring
1. **Performance Monitoring**: Implement Core Web Vitals tracking
2. **Error Tracking**: Set up error monitoring (Sentry, LogRocket, etc.)
3. **SEO Monitoring**: Regular sitemap and structured data validation
4. **Form Analytics**: Track form submission success rates

### Future Enhancements
1. **A/B Testing**: Framework ready for testing implementations
2. **Progressive Web App**: PWA features can be added incrementally
3. **Internationalization**: i18n structure can be implemented
4. **Advanced Analytics**: Enhanced tracking for marketing insights
