# Google PageSpeed Insights Performance Optimization Report

## Executive Summary

This report details comprehensive performance optimizations implemented to address Google PageSpeed Insights issues for the CreateTOTALLY website. The optimizations target Core Web Vitals improvements, image optimization, JavaScript bundle reduction, and third-party script optimization.

## Performance Issues Addressed

### 1. ✅ Image Optimization
**Problem**: Unoptimized images affecting Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
**Solution**: 
- Replaced all Chakra UI `<Image>` components with Next.js `<Image>` component
- Added proper `width`, `height`, and `priority` props
- Implemented lazy loading for below-the-fold images
- Configured modern image formats (AVIF, WebP) in Next.js config

**Files Modified**:
- `app/page.tsx`: Lines 471-483, 513, 546-553, 610-622, 699-711
- `next.config.js`: Lines 13-16

**Expected Impact**: 20-30% improvement in LCP and overall loading performance

### 2. ✅ JavaScript Bundle Optimization
**Problem**: Large initial JavaScript bundle blocking First Input Delay (FID)
**Solution**:
- Implemented dynamic imports for heavy libraries (Vimeo player)
- Added webpack bundle splitting for vendor chunks
- Optimized GSAP loading and execution
- Enabled tree shaking and dead code elimination

**Files Modified**:
- `app/page.tsx`: Lines 15-30 (dynamic imports)
- `next.config.js`: Lines 47-72 (webpack optimization)

**Expected Impact**: 15-25% reduction in initial bundle size

### 3. ✅ Font and Resource Optimization
**Problem**: Render-blocking resources and font loading delays
**Solution**:
- Added preconnect hints for Google Fonts and external services
- Implemented DNS prefetching for Hygraph CMS
- Added resource hints for GTM and Termly

**Files Modified**:
- `app/layout.tsx`: Lines 45-49

**Expected Impact**: 10-20% improvement in First Contentful Paint (FCP)

### 4. ✅ Third-Party Script Optimization
**Problem**: Blocking third-party scripts affecting page load
**Solution**:
- Changed Termly script loading strategy from `afterInteractive` to `lazyOnload`
- Optimized Google Tag Manager integration
- Added service worker for aggressive caching

**Files Modified**:
- `app/layout.tsx`: Lines 71-75
- `public/sw.js`: Complete service worker implementation

**Expected Impact**: 10-15% improvement in Total Blocking Time (TBT)

### 5. ✅ Core Web Vitals Optimizations
**Problem**: Layout shifts and cumulative layout shift (CLS) issues
**Solution**:
- Added critical CSS to prevent FOUC and layout shifts
- Implemented proper image dimensions to prevent reflow
- Added loading states for dynamic content

**Files Modified**:
- `app/layout.tsx`: Lines 78-101 (critical CSS)
- `app/page.tsx`: Image dimension fixes throughout

**Expected Impact**: 30-40% improvement in CLS score

### 6. ✅ Caching Strategy Enhancement
**Problem**: Suboptimal caching leading to repeat resource loading
**Solution**:
- Implemented comprehensive service worker with cache-first strategy
- Added runtime caching for API calls and static assets
- Enhanced Next.js image caching configuration

**Files Created**:
- `public/sw.js`: Service worker implementation
- `public/manifest.json`: PWA manifest

**Expected Impact**: 25-35% improvement in repeat visit performance

## Technical Implementation Details

### Image Optimization Configuration
```javascript
// next.config.js
images: {
  domains: ['eu-west-2.graphassets.com'],
  formats: ['image/avif', 'image/webp'],
  minimumCacheTTL: 31536000, // 1 year
  deviceSizes: [640, 750, 828, 1080, 1200, 1920, 2048, 3840],
  imageSizes: [16, 32, 48, 64, 96, 128, 256, 384],
}
```

### Bundle Splitting Strategy
```javascript
// Webpack configuration for optimal chunking
splitChunks: {
  chunks: 'all',
  cacheGroups: {
    vendor: { test: /[\\/]node_modules[\\/]/, name: 'vendors', priority: 10 },
    chakra: { test: /[\\/]node_modules[\\/](@chakra-ui|@emotion)[\\/]/, name: 'chakra', priority: 20 },
    gsap: { test: /[\\/]node_modules[\\/]gsap[\\/]/, name: 'gsap', priority: 20 }
  }
}
```

### Service Worker Caching Strategy
- **Static Assets**: Cache-first with long-term storage
- **API Calls**: Network-first with cache fallback
- **HTML Pages**: Network-first for freshness, cache fallback for offline

## Performance Metrics Expected Improvements

### Before Optimization (Estimated)
- **Performance Score**: 60-70/100
- **LCP**: 4.5-5.5s
- **FID**: 200-300ms
- **CLS**: 0.15-0.25

### After Optimization (Expected)
- **Performance Score**: 85-95/100
- **LCP**: 2.5-3.0s (30-40% improvement)
- **FID**: 100-150ms (40-50% improvement)
- **CLS**: 0.05-0.10 (60-70% improvement)
